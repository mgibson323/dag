## Description

I wrote this script to use at work - where we are constantly checking domain information. This tool grabs a lot of the important information at once, cutting down some time in our workflow. 

Because we use OSX at work, this tool was tested mostly for OSX use. I have found that certain Linux distros may not be able to properly run this app. Also, WHOIS outputs from the bash whois/jwhois is a bit inconsistent. 

It's not much, but this was the first "program" I've ever written, and it was what got me into coding. So, it has a special place. 

## Install

Clone the repo, chmod +x the dag script, shove it in one of your $PATH directories.

## License

This has no license - use it however you want.
